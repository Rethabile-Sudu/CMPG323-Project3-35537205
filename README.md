 Architectural Patterns in CRUD Operations
MVC (Model-View-Controller):

Model: Represents the project and client data, typically in a database. The model includes the business logic for handling these entities.
View: Displays forms for creating and updating projects and clients, lists for reading data, and buttons or links for deleting records.
Controller: Handles user requests, interacts with the model to perform CRUD operations, and updates the view accordingly.
User Interaction:
Create: The user fills out a form (View) to add a new project or client. The form submission triggers the controller, which processes the input and creates a new record in the database (Model).
Read: The user views a list of projects or clients. The controller retrieves the data from the model and passes it to the view to be displayed.
Update: The user selects a project or client to edit, modifies the details in a form, and submits it. The controller updates the corresponding record in the model.
Delete: The user clicks a delete button next to a project or client. The controller removes the record from the model and updates the view to reflect the change.
Microservices:

CRUD operations might be handled by different microservices, especially in a large application. For instance, there could be separate services for managing projects and clients.
User Interaction: When a user performs a CRUD operation, the relevant microservice is called. For example, creating a new client might involve a microservice that validates the input, interacts with the client database, and returns a confirmation.
